# 3D / AR-Viewer

Display .glb and .reality in AR mode.

## Description 📝

The application consists of a model-viewer which takes .glb and .reality files.

It is possible to send button-text query strings.

Like so: /TheURL?text=View This in AR

Where the text on the button is set to "View This in AR". <br>
If no text query is sent a hardcoded string of "Testa i din hemmamiljö" is displayed.

## Current status 💭

Added text query string variable so it is now possible to change the text of the button.
